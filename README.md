Generational Garbage Collection:
- This project implements a generational garbage collection system in C. The goal is to efficiently manage memory allocation and deallocation by categorizing objects based on their lifespan and collecting them accordingly.

Files in the Repository:
- duMalloc.c: Contains the implementation of the memory allocation and garbage collection logic.
- dumalloc.h: Header file declaring the functions and structures used in duMalloc.c.
- mallocTestVersion4.c: Test file to demonstrate and validate the functionality of the garbage collection system.
- version4output.txt: Output file capturing the results of running mallocTestVersion4.c.
- makefile: Makefile to compile the project.
